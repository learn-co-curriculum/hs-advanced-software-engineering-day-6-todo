## Welcome to Day 6!!!

Today, we'll be wrapping up and presenting our group projects, as well as doing a design activity. For today's ToDo: 

1. Finish incorporating login, signup, and logout into your Fwitter. Use the Fwitter repo from today as a guide. You'll have some time this afternoon to finish this on your group project, plus add styling and bonus features before your presentations. Understanding how these features function in Fwitter will help you incorporate it into your own projects! 

2. Once your Fwitter is up and running, get more practice using Sessions with the Sinatra Sessions ToDo. It'll walk you through writing different data into the session hash.
